*Metric Embedding Theory and Its Algorithmic Applications*, 67720, Fall 2019


The main subject of the course is Metric Embedding Theory, with a focus on discrete metric spaces and its use in approximation algorithms.

This field is in the intersection of computer science and mathematics and has been one of the most extensively studied in theoretical computer science in the past 10 years, and has been a basis for some breakthrough results in the theory of algorithms.

Some of the techniques have been useful also in other fields of computer science such as learning theory and computational biology. 
In mathematics, the topic is closely related to various fields, most notably to Banach space theory in functional analysis.
